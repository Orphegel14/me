no idea where the labbook is so i'll just type it in notes and update it later.
Why is python not working I donwloaded it both from the microsoft app and the offical website, just delated and redownloaded it again nothing seems to have changed?
wait i have to reload it... just did so and everything seems to be working (facepalm)

tried to run python ../course/set1/tests.py didn't work can't open file and [Errno 2] No such file or directory??? copied the file and another error showed up??
ignoring this and moving on, lets see if i can do the work first... saved it and it worked? I can commit this!

update asked ben for help there was a problem with my file? i had a me inside the course or something, anyways everything works now i can check if the tests run
